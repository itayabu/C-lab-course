=  Description:  =
==================
CheckDependency:
program program recieve a file containing list of files and their dependency files list
program check and print if there are cycles of dependency between all the files in the list.

Decrypt:
program recive a number and a string and retunt its coded string.
every char in the string is moving by the shift value in a circled way.

MyStrCmp:
program compare between tow strings
program receive 2 strings as input, and compare them.
if either string length is greater than 30 program return error note
 
MyStrLen:
program read a string from consule and and return its length
if string is bigger than 25, program return error note.

StrLen.c, StrLen.h:
at start I built this header to use it in two or maybe even three files. after alot of work I
noticed there is no need for it in any other file, yet I decided to include it just for
the check of makefile and other stuff

CheckDependency:
I talked about this ex with people who told me they read from the file twice. I worked hard to make 
it possible to read from the file only once. I added two ints to the "depFile" struct so I can better manage
the steps in the reading and checking.
also I heard about the parsing function for strings long after I build my own parsing system
and I liked it so I kept it.
the recursive DFS system let every file that had been checked already, not to be checked again and this sherts
the recursive run time alot.
