==================
GenericHashTable.h
interface to a generic hash table include constructors for both the table and the objects in it,
search, print and free(for both) functions, and structs for table and object.
GenericHashTable.c
implementation to a generic hash table include constructors for both the table and the objects in it,
search, print and free(for both) functions.
MyIntFunctions.c
has three functions- hash function to place each int to its regard place in table,
compare function to determine if the key int is equal to the int in the current cell
print function- to print the value of key
MyStrFunction
has three functions- hash function to place each string in its regard place in table,
compare function to determine if the key string is equal to the string in the current cell
print function- to print the value of key
makefile
build HashIntSearch, HashStrSearch and a static library of GenericHashTable.
