======================
CheckEnclosure:
since all of the ex. was one big function I thought it will be more readable without sub-functions.

ChangeBase:
I think because the meaning of "changeBaseToTen" and "changeBaseFromTen" are very different they should be in
different functions though I could make them in one.
